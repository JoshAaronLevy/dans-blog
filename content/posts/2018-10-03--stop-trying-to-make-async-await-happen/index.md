Since the beginning of time, developers have fought many silly fights. From the classic _"Tabs vs. Spaces"_ to the timeless _"Mac vs. PC"_ debate, we're good at finding distracting arguments.

<!-- We're going to look at 2 rules to improve your life with Promises. -->

I've noticed a misconception in the JavaScript & NodeJS communities. It's that `async`/`await` is the [Promises replacement](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/async-functions) [everyone's](https://hackernoon.com/6-reasons-why-javascripts-async-await-blows-promises-away-tutorial-c7ec10518dd9) [been](https://twitter.com/umaar/status/1045655069478334464) waiting for. (Hint: nope.)

> **No, nope, and not even a little.**

A recent addition to VS Code seems to advance this bias. As [@umaar](https://twitter.com/umaar) tweeted:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Visual Studio Code can now convert your long chains of Promise.then()&#39;s into async/await! 🎊 Works very well in both JavaScript and TypeScript files. .catch() is also correctly converted to try/catch ✅ <a href="https://t.co/xb39Lsp84V">pic.twitter.com/xb39Lsp84V</a></p>&mdash; Umar Hansa (@umaar) <a href="https://twitter.com/umaar/status/1045655069478334464?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2018</a></blockquote>

<!-- Sure, it's an impressive addition to an already amazing list of features. -->

If you hate Promises, and want this refactoring feature, I don't blame you.
<br />
_I empathize. I understand._

I've been there. 🤗

I have completely flipped how I feel about Promises now. **They are amazing.** and my "top 2 rules" were critical in finding the `Promise` Land (#sorrynotsorry).

#### Top 2 Rules

1. [Named functions (no anonymous)](#rule-1)
1. [Single-purpose functions](#rule-2)

<h2 id="rule-1">Rule #1: Named Functions!</h2>

Kill your anonymous methods. Using named functions makes code read like a beat-poetry version of the requirements/steps.

Let's look at a common example:

Making an HTTP GET request using `fetch`: the fetch specification states [HTTP status codes](https://http.cat/) over 400 or 500 **do not automatically trigger an error.** The default in many AJAX libraries (jQuery, axios).

Before we see the solution, look over a common "recommended" implementation:

#### Anti-Pattern

```js
// ❌ Using anonymous inline functions 💩
fetch(url)
  .then(response => response.status < 400
    ? response
    : Promise.reject(new Error('Request Failed: ' + response.ststus)))
  .then(response => response.text())
```

#### Solution: Named Methods

```js
// ✅ Clarity emerges: named functions
fetch(url)
  .then(checkResponse)
  .then(getText)


// Reusable general-purpose functions
function checkResponse(response) {
  return response.status < 400
    ? response
    : Promise.reject(new Error('Request Failed: ' + response.ststus))
}
function getText(response) {
  return response.text()
}
```

> The benefits of this approach are increasingly apparent as you get DRY-er code.

**Additional Resources:** Check out my **1 minute videos** of [basic logging](https://www.youtube.com/xR_MZE1SIkk) and [advanced debugging](https://www.youtube.com/P_tghqWj72M) using this technique.

<h2 id="rule-2">Rule #2: Single Purpose (Functions)</h2>

It sounds _deceptively precise_: Single Purpose.

Yet it's so subjective, arbitrary, and sometimes even meaningless.

<!-- Instead of arguing if a given function is sufficiently focused.

I came up with a rough measure for this: `Purpose Cost`. The higher the score, more likely it's doing too much.

```js
// 1 point: the return & ternary are effectively a one-liner
function checkResponse(response) {
  return response.status < 400
    ? response
    : Promise.reject(new Error('Request Failed: ' + response.ststus))
}
// 1 point: the return & expression are also effectively a one-liner
function getText(response) {
  return response.text()
}
```

Given a function's code, add 1 point for every line containing any of: `if`, `return`, ternary, `for`, `const`, `let`, `var`, `switch`, `while`, `[].map/filter/reduce/etc`. Add 1 point for each instruction (ignore extra lines from whitespace). A number of chained expressions or methods only count for 1 point.

Whew, that was a bit of jargon.
 -->

Interestingly, most developers report they are _pretty dang good_ at **Single Purpose**'ing their code. Not unrelated: they report being great drivers too!

<!-- This **isn't a unique issue with Promises**, array methods and all other HoF-based (Higher Order Function) APIs have the same ergonomics. -->

Even the (incredibly talented) [Jake Archibald](https://twitter.com/jaffathecake) wrote up [an article on Google Developers site](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/async-functions) which has examples that could benefit from my **Rules**

Let's look at one of the so called "❌ Not recommended" Promise examples. (The description is "say we wanted to fetch a series URLs and log them as soon as possible, in the correct order.")

```js
// source: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/async-functions
function logInOrder(urls) {
  // fetch all the URLs
  const textPromises = urls.map(url => {
    return fetch(url).then(response => response.text());
  });

  // log them in order
  textPromises.reduce((chain, textPromise) => {
    return chain.then(() => textPromise)
      .then(text => console.log(text));
  }, Promise.resolve());
}
```

As Jake points out, the `.reduce` is too complex. It doesn't make sense to hand-write nuanced mechanisms all over your code. Put another way, we don't write DOM creation code with endless `document.createElement()`, `element.setAttribute()`, etc. Instead we choose the best tool out of many options: helper/utility functions, libraries or frameworks.

We need to isolate each 'step' that's going on: there's an HTTP request, a transform for a list of URLs into a list of results. Also a `console.log` is needed.

<!-- > 🤔 Why do `Promises` cause developers to abandon practices we use elsewhere? -->

<!-- **Note:** If the intention was to _initiate requests_ in a sequence, instead of merely printing the results out in order, this code doesn't actually do that. We'll refactor accordingly. -->

### Solution: Single Purpose Functions

#### Begin by **extracting methods**...

#### Continue by replacing the `.reduce()` and `logPromise()` with a `Promise.all` and a `.forEach()/.map()`...
